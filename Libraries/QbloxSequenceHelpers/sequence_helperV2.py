Author: Kyle MacRobbie

Edits: Made by Ben Van Osch and Rishabh Iyer, detailed below

1. The first edit was to the make_output_sequence() function, to change condition for using the awg offset 
   for square pulses rather than using the play command. This edit was made because to make a sequence of 
   square pulses that are longer than 65535 ns, you cannot use the upd_param command which has a limit at 
   65535 ns. Previously, make_output_sequence() only decided to switch to waveforms if the length of ramps 
   was > 16384 ns, but we also needed it to switch if blocks are longer than 16384 ns.

2. The second edit was to introduce a plot_input_multi() function. This is useful if the user wishes to, say,
   perform a 2D voltage sweep and check if the outputs are what the user expects, without having to write 
   multiple lines for each output. In general, this function will output plots for each sequencer input against time.

3. The third edit was an addition of some error messages to ensure that users aren't inputting mismatching parameters.

4. The fourth edit is an attempt to replace the make_output_sequence() function with one that only uses square pulses.
   The reason for this is, for long enough pulses, squares seems to have a better resolution than ramps. Currently,
   it seems like using set_awg_offs is a more reliable method than using ramps, so long as you have enough space for
   wait/upd_param commands in your Q1ASM program.

5. The fifth edit is to add an input offset function that Luke had initially created. The QRM, on top of having a
   built-in amplifier that we must account for, also has an offset due to ADC thermal effects. This function allows
   the user to quickly calculate the offset and adjust for it in their code.

6. Modified make_rf_sequence and connect_rf_output to set NCO frequency in Q1ASM and LO in QCoDeS. 

7. Added rf_sweep functionality to make_rf_sequence.
